Project Overview

This project compares the performance of multiple machine learning models (k-NN, Logistic Regression, and LDA) in classifying Parkinsonâ€™s disease using voice features. It includes model training, testing, and hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV.
Files

    Parkinsons_ML_Comparison.ipynb: Contains the code for comparing the performance of the machine learning models.
    DB_Voice_Features.csv: The dataset used for the models.

Instructions

    Open the Jupyter Notebook.
    Ensure the dataset (DB_Voice_Features.csv) is in the same directory as the notebook.
    Run the cells to see model performance and the impact of hyperparameter optimization.
